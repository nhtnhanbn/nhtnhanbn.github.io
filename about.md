## About me

Pleased to meet you!
My name is Nhan and I am a resident of Melbourne.
Also a year 12 student in 2022.

The intention of this website is to be a repository of some documents and articles of interest to me and maybe to you. In addition, there are a few tools I have coded.

I sometimes post on my Instagram account [@nhan.an.victorian](https://instagram.com/nhan.an.victorian),
usually about education and youth issues. I will also notify of updates to this website (new or updated posts) through Instagram.

Want to talk or have something to share?
You can contact me on Instagram [@nhan.an.victorian](https://instagram.com/nhan.an.victorian)
or by email [nhtnhanbn@gmail.com](mailto:nhtnhanbn@gmail.com).
