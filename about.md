## About me

Pleased to meet you!
My name is Nhan and I live in Melbourne.
Also a second-year university student in 2024, at Monash University in the Faculties of Engineering and Information Technology.

The intention of this website is to be a repository of some documents and articles of interest to me and maybe to you.
I started it back in 2022 when I was a year 12 student at a school in Melbourne.

I sometimes post on my Instagram account [@nhan.an.victorian](https://instagram.com/nhan.an.victorian),
usually about education and youth issues. I will also notify of updates to this website (new or updated posts) through Instagram.

Want to talk or have something to share?
You can contact me on Instagram [@nhan.an.victorian](https://instagram.com/nhan.an.victorian),
by email [nhtnhanbn@gmail.com](mailto:nhtnhanbn@gmail.com), or my anonymous [dropbox](/dropbox).

Any personal sources will not be disclosed or acknowledged without mutual agreement.
