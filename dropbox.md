## The dropbox

Want to talk or have something to share? An article, a youth voice resource, a reading, a first-hand story, feedback, hatemail?

The best way to contact me is by email to [nhtnhanbn@gmail.com](mailto:nhtnhanbn@gmail.com)
or on Instagram [@nhan.an.victorian](https://instagram.com/nhan.an.victorian).

If for whatever reason those options do not work best for you, you can use the [anonymous dropbox](https://forms.gle/36vELhSbTmu1cD2q7) and I will be notified if you leave anything in there.
Alternatively, other secure options are

[Proton Mail](https://proton.me/mail) - address nhtnhanbn@proton.me - you can send to this email address from any other email service, but for security it is recommended to use a Proton Mail account to send and follow other best practices.

[Signal](https://signal.org) - username nhan.28

Physical dropbox - for paper. If you have material that does not fit please contact me to make arrangements. Locker 100 is more likely to be found. To ensure that I find your material you should notify me if you leave anything in either location.
