## Monash Labor Club around 1970

### Background

The relevance of the old Monash Labor Club, which was active in the early years of Monash University, is its role in material support of the secondary [student underground](/underground) movement. The activity of the Monash Labor Club gave Monash University a reputation of being Australia's radical campus.
