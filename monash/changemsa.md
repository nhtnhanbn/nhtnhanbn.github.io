## Together no more: a recapitulation of the 2023 MSA elections

### In brief

- Change has won the 2023 Monash Student Association elections, winning all open office bearer positions.
- Incumbents Together have been ousted after 6 years in power.
- In an extraordinarily close election, Social Justice (Monash Socialists) achieved its highest vote in at least a decade.
- Change has a majority on the Monash Student Council, but all tickets will have a voice.

### In full(er)

For years, various tickets tried to unseat political juggernauts Together from Clayton's Monash Student Association, and each year Mojo News rolled out the same headline: "Together again". Together's electoral machine, which the Labor Right participates in, became so invincible, seemingly impossible to defeat, that last year's MSA elections were almost uncontested. But this year, the campus Labor Left and its allies under the Change ticket, along with Socialist Alternative ticket Social Justice, leveraged student anger over the MSA's proposal that students live with students, its response to extension changes and its budget deficit to oust Together. 2023 had seen elevated political activity at Monash, with social media being weaponised to undermine support for Together and Change candidates interfering with general meetings earlier in the year including [Radio Monash](/radmon) and [WIRED](/wired).

For the first time in years, most elections were a three-way race - between Together, Change (successors of the Student Voice of the 2020-2021 elections) and Social Justice. With only Indigenous Officer and the Mental Health and Resilience Committee elected unopposed, this is a drastic change from the 2022 MSA election in which Together was the only serious ticket. When the Election Guide was released, it was clear that Together was not fully prepared for the scale of the threat it faced from the rival tickets - the Election Guide was devoid of any Together headshots and statements for every committee were missing.

The day before polls opened, a member of the campus Labor Left, but not a candidate, posted to the Monash Stalkerspace Facebook group. They urged students to vote against Together, recalling an earlier incident in which the 2023 MSA Residential Communities Officer, and Presidential candidate in the election, reported a critical Stalkerspace post relating to the MSA's housing proposal. Under the MSA Election Regulations, controlled by Together, this is prohibited conduct. The post was quickly deleted.

However, it set the tone for Change's strategy. On the day the election officially opened, posters appeared throughout the Clayton campus. These included attacks claiming that "Together caused a $1.5 million deficit" and "Together's solution to the housing crisis was for you to live with your tutors". The solution, they said - "It's time for Change". Many posters were torn down.

Alongside social media campaigns, the election also saw campaigners from all tickets harass students for votes in person. There were unverified reports of campaigners repeatedly breaching the Election Regulations, including handling students' devices to submit votes. At least one formal complaint was submitted to the Returning Officer - a Social Justice campaigner allegedly instructed a voter, who did not self-identify as queer, to tick the box allowing them to vote for the Queer Officer election.

In the end, 5260 students cast their vote in this election representing 12.1% of eligible voters. Change won President, Secretary, Treasurer, Lot's Wife, and every office bearer position except for Disabilities & Carers Officer and Womenâ€™s Officer won by Together, and Queer Officer won by Social Justice. The Monash Student Council General Representatives were split, with 2 each going to Together and Change and 1 to Social Justice.

In total, this gives Change 14 seats, a controlling majority, on the 24-seat Monash Student Council, the highest body in the MSA. In the minority will be multiple seats held by Together and Social Justice, as well as divisional presidents independent of the MSA election.

While the MSC majority won by Change and its sweep of open office bearer positions might give the illusion of a landslide, this three-way election was in fact the closest this decade. That Change won so many positions despite actually coming second on primary votes is an effect of the MSA's majoritarian electoral system, in contrast to more proportional SRC-style systems found at some other universities.

For the Presidential election, which had results similar to most office bearer elections, on primary votes Together was first on 1806 (36%), followed by Change on 1737 (35%) and Social Justice (28%) on 1411. Following exclusion of Social Justice, 1087 votes exhausted (did not indicate any second preference), representing a 77% exhaustion rate. Of the remainder of Social Justice votes that did not exhaust, preferences overwhelmingly flowed to Change at a rate of 72%, propelling Change to narrowly overtake Together and secure the Presidency with the final two-candidate preferred vote tally being 1970 (50.9%) - 1897 (49.1%).

Queer Officer was possibly the most controversial election. In the past several years, the Rainbow Collective ticket has run unopposed. This year, however, Social Justice also contested the election, whilst Change and Together observed convention by endorsing a vote for the Rainbow Collective. On social media and on campus, Rainbow Collective and Social Justice battled over their diverging visions for the Queer Department - a safe space for the campus community as advocated by the Rainbow Collective against a political, activist and left-wing queer office.

The final result saw Social Justice take the Queer Office with 608 votes (65%) to Rainbow Collective's 331 votes (35%). However, this result is called into question amid allegations of voter fraud encouraged by Social Justice campaigners.

Change will narrowly control the Activities Advisory Committee after Social Justice did not contest. Together will control the Mental Health and Resilience Committee after they were unopposed. No single ticket won a majority of the Student Affairs Committee, Welfare Committee, Environmental and Social Justice Committee, Creative and Live Arts Committee, Women's Committee, and People of Colour Collective, with all three tickets represented in each.

Delegates to the National Union of Students will be 3 Together (Student Unity/Labor Right), 2 Change (National Labor Students/Labor Left), and 2 Social Justice (Socialist Alternative).

The referendum on the definition of "carer" failed despite 91% of votes in favour, as turnout was only 1.77% of eligible voters which is far below the 5% turnout required. Only Together's how to vote suggested a Yes vote, with the other tickets ignoring the referendum altogether. That other referendum? As of 21/10/2023, the vote count is at a 49.6% Yes vote in Chisholm and Hotham is 49.1% for Yes.

The last time an incumbent ticket was overthrown was the 2017 realignment election, when Together defeated the Labor Left-backed Go ticket who had controlled the MSA for a decade. Like this time, the election before Together's emergence had been practically uncontested. Unlike 2017, Change was the second-most popular ticket, only narrowly overtaking Together. In the year ahead, Change will have the challenge of proving it can provide a serious and competent administration for the MSA and consolidate its support among students.
