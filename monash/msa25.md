## 2025 elections of the Monash Student Association

Disclaimer: no guarantees of factual accuracy. Some claims are based on best evidence.

Updates on this page in reverse chronological order.

Polls are open Monday 1st September to Thursday 4th September. Students will vote in elections of MSA office bearers, committees and National Union of Students delegates.

### [Election timeline](http://msa.monash.edu/hubfs/MSA%20Election%20Timeline%202025.pdf)

### Polls closed

Update 4/9/2025

Voting has closed in the MSA elections.

Overall turnout will likely be down, but after changes made to the online voting platform to make it easier to vote for autonomous departments, turnout in those elections will far exceed last year's numbers.

### Offensive publicity

Update 3/9/2025 - 23 hours until polls close

Some of the tickets have had to modify their material after printing to comply with electoral regulations.

Elevate's flyers and posters have required manual stamping of the authorised officer authorisation and the newly mandated "Please Recycle" notice. Party in the MSA's campaign shirts have required adding a sticky note with the authorised officer authorisation, although this was not strictly followed at all times.

Postering has been predominantly by Change, spruiking their achievements, along with some posters by Elevate attacking the supposed dysfunction of the MSA and underfunding of clubs and societies under Change.

### Monash for Palestine endorses Change

Update 2/9/2025 - 2 days until polls close

Like last year, Monash for Palestine has endorsed Change, with which it has deep connections. Monash for Palestine also specifically claimed that Elevate is a rebranded version of the "Zionist" Together ticket.

### Polls open

Update 1/9/2025 - 3 days until polls close

Voting in student union elections has opened across the state. Throughout Monash's Clayton campus, campaigners are already on the ground with Change, Elevate, Free Palestine and Party in the MSA all having a presence.

### Polls open in the morning

Update 31/8/2025 - 12 hours until polls open

After eligibility checks, 1 Pride candidate for Queer Affairs Committee, 4 Change candidates for committees and one of the unaffiliated candidates for Indigenous Officer had their nominations rejected for not being an eligible student.

Like in 2024, Socialist Alternative members are running on the Change ticket (and endorsed by Free Palestine) for Education (Public Affairs) Officers, one of the two Environment & Social Justice Officers, and the National Union of Students.

Of the 9 candidates elected on the Change ticket to the Queer Department in 2024, none of them are running again with Change this year. 6 have defected to Access & Pride, running against Change mainly in the Queer Department.

The [Election Guide](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/70719581/msa-2025-election-guide) has been released, containing ticket and candidate photos and statements. Elevate did not send a ticket statement, or any statements for committees or the National Union of Students. Party in the MSA did not send a ticket statement or a statement for the People of Colour Collective. Change did not send a statement for the Create & Live Arts Committee.

The Party in the MSA Secretary and the Change Education (Public Affairs) Officers narrowly exceeded the word count limit for their candidate statements.

The Party in the MSA President statement also supports boat cruises, which were [banned](/demise) late last year by the autonomous Clubs & Societies division of the MSA.

On social media, Change recently announced a policy to trial offering students a free drink after their exams from Sir John's Bar. This prompted suggestions that the policy was inspired by Party in the MSA's core more beers policy platform. Change's announcement came two weeks after Party in the MSA released a wide-ranging drinks policy.

Change policies include
- Expanding 24/7 Matheson Library areas
- Free food programmes including free breakfast every weekday
- Earlier semester 2 mid-semester break

Elevate policies include
- Monash Connect and University Health Services accessibility
- 3-day automatic short extensions
- $200 emergency grants

Party in the MSA policies include
- MSA nuclear deterrent
- Doubling the height of the Menzies building
- 24/7 Sir John's Bar

Access & Pride policies include
- Improving subtitles in lecture materials
- An MSA Accessibility Action Plan
- Ending deadnaming in the classroom

Free Palestine policies include
- University divestment from weapons companies
- $5 lunches on campus
- Free university education

### Nominations in

Update 13/8/2025 - 2 weeks until polls open

All five registered tickets will be on the front page of the ballot.

Most positions will be contested by Change and Elevate, with Party in the MSA joining about half of the elections. Free Palestine will contest for the Environment & Social Justice Officer and Committee, Student Affairs Committee and National Union of Students delegates. The Disabilities & Carers Officer and Committee will be a rematch between Change and the incumbent ticket Access, and the Queer Officers and Collective will contested by Change and Pride. Access & Pride will also run candidates for Monash Student Council General Representatives. Change candidates for Education (Academic Affairs) Officers, Activities Officers and Committee, Residential Community Officers and Lot's Wife Editors are provisionally elected unopposed, with Party in the MSA also receiving a seat on the Activities Advisory Committee. There will be no candidates running independently without a ticket.

Over the past few weeks, Change has been posting constantly, mainly celebrating their wins so far. Party in the MSA has also posted occasionally, including new policies as well as highlighting the Change candidate for Secretary's past Together and Elevate links.

### Tickets registered

Update 2/8/2025 - 4 weeks until polls open.

The [registered tickets](https://msa.monash.edu/hubfs/2025%20MSA%20Notice%20of%20Registered%20tickets_provisional%20(1).pdf) are
- Change (incumbents, led by the Labor Left)
- Elevate (Labor Right subfactions and allies)
- Party in the MSA (joke ticket, Mannix College base)
- Free Palestine (Socialist Alternative)
- Access & Pride

The changes from last year are no Forward (Liberals) or Regen (led by Greens), while the independent Access ticket in the Disabilities & Carers Department has expanded to cover allies running for the Queer Department.

Party in the MSA registered as Party in the REDACTED, but following a complaint that there were more characters in the name than allowed under the new electoral regulations, has renamed to Party in le REDACTED. Meanwhile, the ban on their nuclear deterrent policy has been overturned on appeal.

Change has started posting daily on social media.

### Ticket registrations closed

Update 24/7/2025 - 5 weeks until polls open.

With ticket registrations closed, the contest is expected to be a traditional one mainly between the Labor Left incumbents and a ticket of the Labor Right. Small and autonomous groups struggled to reach the 80 signatures but will be on the ballot in the elections.

Party in the MSA has already been forced to take down one of their early policy posts proposing to establish a nuclear deterrent for the MSA following a complaint.

### Election notice out

Update 16/7/2025 - 6 weeks until polls open.

Ticket registrations opened at 10:00am on Monday 14th July, with the notice of election sent to all students soon after. The next day, the ticket registration form and the election timeline were published on the [MSA website](https://msa.monash.edu/elections). Office Bearer Role Outlines including honoraria were also published.

According to the Returning Officer's election timeline, ticket registrations will close at 5:00pm on Thursday 24th July.

On 4/7/2025 I incorrectly stated that "feeder tickets have not been a thing in any MSA election in recorded history". But evidence does support the claim that generally "they are useless when voters fully control their preferences", which is the point that matters because it is the current system. MSA elections had [group voting tickets](https://antonygreen.com.au/voter-preferences-set-be-ignored-at-the-2022-victorian-legislative-council-election/) before 2022, in which preferences were entirely controlled by the ticket receiving a front page vote, not the voter. Feeder tickets can be seen in [2017](https://22189712.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/22189712/Election%20Results/2017%20MSA%20Notice%20of%20Results.pdf) and [2016](https://22189712.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/22189712/Election%20Results/2016%20MSA%20Notice%20of%20results.pdf) - the withdrawn tickets in committee elections. Feeder tickets have not been a thing in any MSA election since the 2022 reform.

Additionally, it is worth noting that the efforts to change the definition of "carer" in the MSA constitution have a specific impetus. The current definition has been exploited for electoral advantage. A fundamental weakness of most autonomous elections is that they rely on voters to self-identify, which means there are [no controls](/msa23) on whether the voter is genuinely part of the autonomous group. However, it is against the rules for campaigners to encourage voters to dishonestly identify themselves as eligible to vote.

In 2020, Together [asked](https://monashstudentassociation.com.au/app/uploads/2020/10/2020.10.29-EIR-David-Shaw-Appeal-decision.pdf) its members to vote in the Disabilities & Carers Officer election if they fit in the broad definition of "carer" given by the MSA constitution, even if they were undertaking care only as an MNHS student. The result ended up being close, Together winning with 260 votes against Student Voice's 220. An appeal against the result by an outgoing D&C Officer was rejected on the basis of the MSA constitution's definition.

### Election regulations replaced and election dates set

Update 4/7/2025 - 8 weeks until polls open.

Elections and referenda were dealt with at a marathon [MSC 6](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KQhedowwkAawCfWdDEMeVT62fDiqOc1o/view?usp=sharing) on [Wednesday 2nd July](https://twitter.com/LotsWifeMag/status/1940212305062690845).

Amendments to the MSA constitution passed by student referendum in [2018](https://22189712.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/22189712/Election%20Results/2018%20MSA%20Notice%20of%20Results.pdf), [2020](https://22189712.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/22189712/Election%20Results/2020%20MSA%20Notice%20of%20Results.pdf) and [2021](https://22189712.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/22189712/Election%20Results/2021%20MSA%20Notice%20of%20Results.pdf) had not been lodged with the Registrar of Incorporation Associations as required due to the MSA's incorporation, so this MSC had to validate them and in one case call a Special General Meeting to formally adopt the amendment. The Clubs & Societies President (and Executive Division representative) Jay blamed Together for the errors, as they occurred during their tenure.

Moving onto the approaching elections, former Change authorised officer Jay, seconded by the Change authorised officer (and Secretary) Felix, proposed revoking the [Election Regulations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oCIeOJdM98T4nKtbW9IC9Mh5jnPTC9e0/view?usp=sharing) and replacing them with freshly drafted [Election and Referendum Regulations](https://22189712.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/22189712/MSA%20Election%20Regulations%202025-07-02.pdf). The initial draft had been reviewed by the election organiser OGL Group and the MSA lawyer with most recommendations incorporated into the final proposal. Only the MSA Executive was consulted in drafting the new regulations - other members of the Change ticket, the MSC, other factions and MSA members were not, apparently due to the urgency. According to the Executive, they had planned to consult more widely after drafting but the process took longer than expected.

The MSC was given 7 days notice of the proposal - the old regulations required 7 days notice to amend and the new regulations require 14 days notice, and regulations cannot be amended after the appointment of the Returning Officer for an election. This meant that given the Executive's proposed election date, the proposed regulations could not be amended at this meeting or any time later before the election. Both the old and new regulations required the MSC to appoint the returning officer and electoral tribunal no later than the Monday "9 weeks" before the annual elections, but an exception was made for this year to extend the deadline to Wednesday - coincidentally the date of the MSC meeting given an election week of week 6 semester 2.

The old Election Regulations, first adopted in 2000 and amended many times since, had become unwieldy with broken internal cross-references and a structure that they believed was difficult to navigate. The new regulations were mostly a restructure and renumbering with content based on the old regulations, but also came linked with several substantive changes.

These included a few changes to the rules around ticket registration. Ticket names will have "Monash" and "MSA" explicitly banned - last year Party in the MSA was forced to rename to Party in the REDACTED and there was an unsuccessful challenge to Regen - Regeneration at Monash. They will also need to be no longer than 20 characters including spaces - Regen was 30.

And the protection of previously registered ticket names was extended from 3 years to 5 years requiring consent of the last authorised officer holding the ticket name, plus if a ticket did not nominate any candidate but was registered at all in the past 5 years there is no way to register the ticket name. The Grassroots name, which had been the Greens-linked ticket Regen's first choice in 2024, was last [registered by the Labor Right](/msa) in 2022 meaning that it would have become available for the 2026 elections under the 2024 rules. This rule had first been introduced by the Change-controlled MSC before the 2024 elections, preventing registration of the Grassroots name. The new rules, if they stay, mean that the Grassroots name cannot be claimed until at least 2028.

However, the most controversial change was doubling the number of signatures required to register a ticket from 40 to 80 - getting a ticket is vital to securing a spot on the front page of the ballot, without which it is practically impossible to win an office bearer position. The justification for this was to balance the elimination of nominator and seconder requirements for each candidate in the ticket, streamlining the nomination process for tickets.

Education (Academic Affairs) Officer Paul, while commending the cleaning up of the regulations, questioned the higher ticket registration threshold as counter to the goal of lowering it to 40 last year to have more tickets run when there were no related problems with the 2024 elections. He pointed out that every other student union they were aware of had a lower threshold, and that increasing the threshold hurts smaller tickets while streamlining candidate paperwork helps larger tickets. The Socialist Alternative, the Disabilities & Carers Officer (who defeated Change in the autonomous department with the Access ticket), Education (Academic Affairs) Officers, a Queer Officer and independent observers opposed the doubling of the threshold as anti-democratic and locking out small, non-partisan and autonomous groups. The President Sasha argued that the total effect of changes over the past few years was to make it easier overall to register tickets, and suggested that doubling the threshold would prevent feeder tickets. Feeder tickets have not been a thing in any MSA election ~~in [recorded history](https://msa.monash.edu/elections)~~ since 2022 (see update 5/7/2025) because they are useless when voters fully control their preferences. A related unmentioned consequence of a low threshold would be the possibility of registering a ticket name only to block others from using it, as happened to Grassroots.

After calling for votes in favour of replacing the election regulations, there was a wait as Felix and Sasha asked certain MSC members to vote. Despite their efforts, they could manage only 11 votes in favour with 6 against and 3 abstentions - short of the 13-vote absolute majority required.

Jay asked for a recount.

When votes in favour were called for again, 12 hands went up. Sasha delayed moving on while Felix made a phone call, eventually getting a 13th vote. With 13 votes (mainly the Labor Left) in favour, 6 against and 2 abstentions, the new election regulations passed and will be implemented for this year's elections. International had changed from abstention to in favour, while one of the Change members had voted in favour after failing to vote in the first count.

SAlt was also concerned about the early proposed date of the election requiring ticket signatures to be collected before semester starts, making it difficult to get that many when students are disengaged from student politics and university in general. The justification given for why week 6 of semester 2 was chosen by the Executive was that it would align with most other Victorian student union elections. This would limit foreign interference by student politicians from other universities, who are technically not allowed to campaign but would "stooge" - posing as a Monash voter to speak to opposing campaigners.

SAlt suggested nevertheless delaying the election, but the Executive insisted that this would not be possible as OGL Group had said they would be available week 6 and had not been asked about other weeks. SAlt demanded that the Executive call OGL Group immediately at the meeting to ask, which Felix rejected as inappropriate. Over the course of debate, they accused the Executive of fixing the election, characterising the timing and conduct of the election regulations and dates motions as strange and irregular.

6 MSC members supported SAlt's proposal of a one-week delay, to hold the elections in week 7 instead, with 10 against and 4 abstentions. Having failed to amend the dates, SAlt and D&C boycotted the vote on the final motion to confirm a week 6 election. With 13 votes in favour and 3 against, the motion passed and the election was set for Monday 1st September to Thursday 4th September, week 6 of semester 2.

D&C moved to run a referendum alongside the elections on the definition of "carer" in the MSA constitution, the third attempt after 2023 and 2024 referenda failed due to insufficient turnout despite overwhelming votes in favour. The 2023 referendum, run with the elections, suffered from problems with visibility on the voting platform and received a 91% Yes vote on 1.77% turnout. The 2024 referendum was run separately in October due to administrative failures and received an 87% Yes vote on 3.04% turnout. Labor members argued that the referendum being run alongside the election would suppress turnout and should instead be run early next year. With 7 votes in favour, 5 against and 3 abstentions, the motion failed to reach the absolute majority required so the referendum will not be held with the MSA elections.

### Background

The [2024 MSA elections](/msa24) saw Change and the Labor Left consolidate their grip on the MSA by absorbing the Socialist Alternative into the ticket, after ending the Together dynasty in [2023's](/msa23) tight three-way race. Since the elections, members of the ticket descended into severe internal [disputes](/dismissal) over personalities, governance and the MSA budget.

Throughout the first half of the year, the 2 positions held by Labor Left General Representatives elected on the Change ticket have seen 3 resignations, each replaced by Change. During the winter break, the MSA Treasurer, one Education (Public Affairs) Officer and one Creative & Live Arts Officer resigned and were replaced by the Monash Student Council, with all incoming office bearers being leading candidates for Change at the 2024 MSA elections. The outgoing EdPub and CLA Officers had practically left and been replaced earlier in the year but their formal resignations were delayed to avoid running expensive by-elections.
