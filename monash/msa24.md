## 2024 elections of the Monash Student Association

Disclaimer: no guarantees of factual accuracy. Some claims are based on best evidence.

Polls are open Monday 16 September to Thursday 19 September.

### Update 6/9/2024 - New C&S Executive elected - 10 days until polls open

The Annual General Meeting of the MSA Clubs and Societies Council has elected a [new C&S Executive](https://www.monashclubs.org/About/Admin-News/C-S-Council-AGM-Election-Results-(1)). Of the big four, three have been linked to Change and one is running this year for an MSA office bearer position and NUS delegate on the Change ticket. C&S is often said to be autonomous and apolitical - it is not surprising that some people interested in being on the C&S Executive would also be interested in being in the MSA and interested in government generally.

### Update 3/9/2024 - Student General Meeting motions passed but not binding - 13 days until polls open

The vote was roughly 450 in favour and 40 against, but failed to meet the threshold of 1% of Clayton students voting in favour and so is not binding on the MSA.

### A context

See the [recap](/changemsa) of the last MSA elections, in which the Change ticket organised by the Labor Left won a narrow victory over the incumbents. Aspects of the election, such as  the circumstances around the formation of the Change coalition and the fall of the dominant Together administration are still very murky. Almost no ordinary student knows or could even imagine the full story. Certainly not me.

A number of positions have changed hands since, some of them apparently less consequential than others. It is worth paying a few words to Dilhan, a member of the Labor Left who continues to be an actor.

<img src="/files/dilhanmoving.png" alt="dilhan (the guy who literally orchestrated and organised the change ticket and is singlehandedly responsible for togethers downfall) is now on academic board?" style="max-width:none">

In 2022, Dilhan was [elected president](/wired) of Wired, the Faculty of IT Society, at the top of a seemingly non-political stack. Later that year, he was elected a General Representative on the MSA Clubs and Societies Executive, a position open to C&S or club office bearers. In July 2023, he was a candidate with the attempted stack of [Radio Monash](/radmon). In the 2023 MSA elections, he was not a candidate but helped to organise and campaign for Change. In February 2024, he was appointed by the Academic Board to fill one of two undergraduate representative positions on Academic Board, after the 2023 MSA President departed. In March 2024, the Monash Student Council General Representative elected second on the Change ticket resigned, and Dilhan ascended to the position. Subsequently, he was elected to be the General Representative sitting on the MSA Executive, a position which had been left vacant after insufficient support for a candidate at an earlier MSC meeting.

The position of Authorised Officer for the Change ticket changed hands and ended up with Dilhan. This gave him the power to appoint people to fill vacancies if a person elected on the Change ticket resigned from their MSA position, besides office bearers but including MSC General Representatives.

### Palestine

From the point of view of the Socialist Alternative, the big focus this year has been Palestine. Through their front Students for Palestine, they organised the solidarity encampment at Monash during May. Repeatedly, they have expressed frustrations with the MSA's lack of support for their cause and the encampment, particularly in defending students from suspension.

In March, the Queer Officers posted to MSA Queer social media, attacking members of the Queer Affairs Committee for moving to restrict their use of social media, which they had been using almost exclusively for Palestine activism. The post was removed with permission of the MSA President. In late May, the Queer Officers claimed to have been locked out of MSA Queer social media. On 31 May, an MSC meeting was scheduled to which Students for Palestine had submitted a number of motions. Labor members of the MSC withheld quorum, and the meeting was rescheduled to 21 June. The rescheduled meeting again could not meet quorum. On 28 June, quorum was finally met and the meeting had to get through a mountain of motions, including organising the MSA elections and passing changes to the Election Regulations. The Students for Palestine motions were finally considered, but were amended without the consent of the movers.

Separately, the Greens Society (and SFP indirectly) called on engineering clubs affiliated with MSA Clubs and Societies to break ties with weapons companies.

### Who is running?

Coming off the back of a remarkably close three-ticket election in 2023, this year will see an extraordinary number of tickets nominate candidates compared to recent MSA elections. The factions participating in tickets are the Labor Left (under Change), Labor Right (Elevate), Socialist Alternative (Free Palestine, Change, unticketed), Greens (Regen) and Liberals (Forward).

The incumbents Change are led by the Labor Left and also includes candidates from the Socialist Alternative for Education (Public Affairs) Officer. Change is running the most candidates of the contesting tickets, with 88 across all positions except Indigenous Officer and the Student Affairs Committee (in which Free Palestine has nominated). An item of trivia about the Change candidate for Treasurer is that they feature in one of the few [documented stacks](/radmon) in recent Monash history.

Elevate, which could be considered successors of the previously dominant Together ticket, is organised by a coalition of subfactions of the Labor Right. Running 86 candidates across all positions except Indigenous Officer and the Queer and D&C Officers and Committees, Elevate will compete directly against Change in the vast majority of elections.

Regen is the first separate Greens-linked ticket since Grassroots was absorbed into the Student Voice ticket with the Labor Left for the pandemic elections and ceased to exist as an identifiable faction. Organisers of the ticket had initially intended to revive the Grassroots brand. However, they were thwarted by newly introduced Election Regulations which prevented them from doing so as the name had been registered by the Labor Right in 2022. Regen is running 25 candidates for President, Treasurer, the ESJ and POC Officers and Committees, Monash Student Council General Representative, Queer Officer, the Women's Affairs Committee and National Union of Students Delegate.

Party in the MSA (also known as Party in the REDACTED) is a ticket formed by Mannix College residents. It is running 12 candidates for President, Secretary, Treasurer, Activities Officer, Education (Public Affairs) Officer, Monash Student Council General Representative, Lot's Wife Editor, People of Colour Officer and National Union of Students Delegate.

This year marks the first distinct Liberal ticket for ten years, in Forward. It is running 10 candidates for President, Secretary, Treasurer, Activities Officer, Education (Academic Affairs) Officer, Education (Public Affairs) Officer, Monash Student Council General Representative, Welfare Officer and National Union of Students Delegate.

The Access ticket is organised by an incumbent Disabilities and Carers Officer who is running for re-election alongside 7 candidates for the D&C Committee.

Free Palestine is led by the Socialist Alternative and members of Students for Palestine, running 7 candidates for the Student Affairs Committee (in which Change has not nominated) and 7 candidates for National Union of Students Delegate. The Socialist Alternative appears to have done a deal with Change, with a few of its members running on the Change ticket for office bearer positions.

Access, Change, Elevate, Forward, Regen and Party in the MSA, in that order, have qualified for the front page of the ballot. Free Palestine failed to reach the front page.

Positions declared elected unopposed are the Queer Affairs Committee, all on the Change ticket, and independent Indigenous Officers. One of the Queer Affairs Committee candidates, a former president of GLEAM (Queers in STEM), ran last year for Queer Officer with Rainbow Collective but was controversially defeated by Social Justice. There is no Rainbow Collective this year, with Queer Officer contested by Change and Regen. One candidate for the Activities Advisory Committee, a member of the Socialist Alternative and incumbent Queer Officer from Social Justice, appears without a ticket.

Keep in mind that candidates in a ticket are not necessarily members of or even aligned with the political faction involved with the ticket.

### Other votes

Students for Palestine ran a petition to call a Student General Meeting. The last (unofficial) SGM had been held online in [2021](/msa), organised by another Socialist Alternative front Defend Democracy at Monash after the Monash Student Council refused to run it in contravention of the MSA constitution. SFP claimed to have gathered over 900 signatures, comfortably enough to require an SGM. The first scheduled MSC meeting at which the petition was to be presented failed to hit quorum. In frustration SFP unilaterally set the date to 3 September. At a rescheduled MSC meeting, that date was unanimously endorsed, despite the MSA claiming to be only able to verify about 250 signatures as belonging to students due to restrictions on student data access. The SGM will be held from 12pm Tuesday 3 September in Campus Centre, 13 days before polls open.

The resolutions proposed by SFP are:
- MSA, on behalf of the students at Monash University Clayton Campus, supports an immediate and just end to Israelâ€™s war on Gaza. This means stopping the bombing, a permanent withdrawal of Israeli troops, an end to the 18-year long blockade, and reparations to be paid for the reconstruction of Gaza.
- MSA calls upon Monash University to reveal and cut all ties with companies and institutions involved in the development and manufacturing of weapons used by the IDF against the Palestinian people.
- MSA will make representations on behalf of students by bringing resolutions [1] and [2] to the attention of the Vice-Chancellor and the General Manager of Monash University.

An election for the student member on the Monash University Council will be held Tuesday 10 September to Tuesday 17 September, essentially the week leading up to the MSA elections. Elections for student members on the Academic Board will be held in October.

There are also many elections and Annual General Meetings coming up for the MSA Divisions and clubs. These include the MSA Clubs and Societies Council's AGM on Wednesday 4 September to elect a new C&S Executive and the Law Students Society's elections from Wednesday 4 September to Friday 8 September.
