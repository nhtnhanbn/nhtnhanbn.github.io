## 2023 elections of the Monash Student Association

Disclaimer: no guarantees of factual accuracy. Some claims are based on best evidence.

### A context

See the background post on the [State of the Monash Student Association](/msa).

### Who is running?

*Based on provisional notice of nominations posted by MSA 21/9/2023. As nominations provisionally ruled ineligible might end up valid, I am considering them as nominations for now.*

Three tickets have nominated candidates for the 2023 MSA election: Together, CHANGE!, Social Justice.

Together, the incumbent ticket since the 2017 election, nominated 127 candidates. The Labor Right participates in this ticket.

CHANGE!, renamed from the pandemic-era Student Voice ticket which did not contest the 2022 elections last year, nominated 74 candidates. This ticket is led and organised by the Labor Left. Their platform calls for greater advocacy, and seems to be pitched broadly towards those seeking "change" from Together running MSA.

Social Justice, the latest manifestation of the perennially unsuccessful Socialist Alternative ticket, nominated 73 candidates, up from 5 Climate Action/Climate Justice candidates in 2022. Their platform is the explicitly left wing and activist one typical of Socialist Alternative student tickets.

Only Together nominated candidates for the Mental Health and Resilience Committee, so they will be elected unopposed. Indigenous Officer will be contested by Change and an independent. Disabilities and Carers Officer will be contested by Together and Change.

Queer Officer will be contested by Social Justice and independents. Incumbent ticket the Rainbow Collective, traditionally winning Queer Officer unopposed, did not register or hold preselections this year. However, an incumbent Queer Officer elected as Rainbow Collective candidate in 2022 has nominated again.

Education (Academic Affairs) Officer and Lot's Wife Editor will be contested by all three tickets as well as an independent. The remainder of the committees and offices, including the President, Secretary and Treasurer, will be contested by all three tickets.

Based on these nominations, this year marks a significant departure from 2022's almost entirely uncontested election, with Together facing possibly its stiffest opposition ever.

### Clubs and Societies

In early September, the C&S Council, composed of all C&S club presidents, held its AGM to elect the 9 members of its new C&S Executive. 4 of the newly elected C&S Executive are candidates of Change for MSA. 2 other members of the incoming C&S Executive were previously elected to MSA on the Together ticket, but are not contesting the 2023 MSA election. 1 of the new C&S Executive will be contesting the 2023 MSA election as an independent.

### Referendum

Concurrently with the 2023 MSA election, a referendum will be held to change the MSA Constitution. The question approved by the Monash Student Council is "Do you agree that the MSA Constitution should be amended to state that a "carer" has the same meaning as in the Carer Recognition Act 2010?"

### Election Regulations changes

In August, the Together-controlled Monash Student Council unanimously passed 5 changes to the Election Regulations. Substantial changes include:
- "Voting digitally on behalf of or for someone else, with the use of their electronic device." is now prohibited conduct.
- "Blocking doors, lifts, stairways and the pathway of students with disabilities, whether or not they utilise mobility devices." is now prohibited conduct.
- "Do Not Approach" badge that "students with disabilities can wear should they require the accommodation of not being approached by campaigners during election week due to the detrimental physical, mental and emotional consequences suffered".
- Requiring the digital ballot be compatible with screen readers.

### Update 26/9/2023 - shock resignation rocks the adult Labor Left - 13 days until polls open

The most senior member of the Victorian Labor Left, and the Victorian Labor Party, announced their unexpected resignation today. Over the next few days, the Labor factions will jostle and negotiate for their replacement and other senior positions.
