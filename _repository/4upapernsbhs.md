## North Sydney Boys High School 4U Paper

### Background

*The 4U Paper* is the student newspaper of the North Sydney Boys High School. The first issue was in 2014 and the paper has been published every year since as of 2022, covering both international news and items of school relevance. Originally an NSBHS SRC publication, in more recent times it has been produced by NSBHS Visions, the school's student-led media and communications committee. *The 4U Paper* was the winner of the upper secondary category of the 2019 Front Page competition run by Nine (*The Age* and the *Sydney Morning Herald*) and Australian Teachers of Media, which invites submissions of single issue short school newspapers, and a finalist in the 2020 competition as *The Nest*. In 2022 and the previous few years *The 4U Paper* published monthly issues during the school year.
