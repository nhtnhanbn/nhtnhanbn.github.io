### Information integrity

I am in the dark.

**If you know an error that should be corrected, content that should be removed, or context to add (basically anything you would change), please [contact me](/dropbox).**

I share, on this site or on Instagram, plenty of what I know. The "standard of proof" to share a fact is that I am convinced that it is true.

Most second-hand information is derived or available from public or quasi-public sources and will continue to be. There is plenty that I do not know - I always open to hear tips or leads. If you have a story to tell I would love to hear it - or even post about it yourself!

My only role in the Monash Student Association or its Clubs and Societies division is as a general member of some clubs and a committee member of fewer. I am not and have never been a member of the C&S Executive. I am not and have never been an office bearer in the MSA or a member of an MSA committee. I have never run as a candidate in a C&S Executive or MSA election.

On my biases in general.
I am political.
I am not objective.
I am not partisan.
I act impartial when it suits me.
