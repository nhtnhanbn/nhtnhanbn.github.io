## VicSRC SGM 11 May 2022 and proposed constitutional amendments

### Background

The Victorian Student Representative Council Student Executive Advisory Committee ("the Executive") has proposed a number of amendments to our SRC's Constitution, concerning the composition of the Executive for future terms but yet again no simplification of the Executive's outrageous full name.

These changes will be voted on by the constitutional Student Members of our SRC at a Special General Meeting on 11 May 2022. As a Student Member of our Victorian SRC, I will be attending the Special General Meeting and would value your feedback and views on the proposed amendments.
