## University student news media

Student journalism, specifically journalism focusing on student and campus affairs, is weak today. Many student media publications, which traditionally carried news, no longer publish university news as it breaks, instead relying on creative, cultural and possibly analysis. This is not always necessarily a deliberate pivot (and there has always been very many solely creative and cultural magazines published by students), but in part an effect of what contributors are writing. If dedicated student journalists no longer exist and nobody writes the news and submits it for publication, student media organisations cannot publish it. There are other reasons too.

An example of my personal experience is this: I a Monash University student found out about Monash NTEU strikes and the University's attempt to retrospectively alter the enterprise agreeement variously through *Honi Soit* (the University of Sydney student newspaper), *Campus Morning Mail* (a now-retired news site targeted more at academics), and the Monash Socialists. I believe that in 2023, neither *Lot's Wife* nor *Mojo News* mentioned any of these rather notable news items.

A second thing was during the 2023 National Union of Students National Conference when at times three or more student media teams were simultaneously live tweeting the same thing, creating possibly unnecessary redundancy. Live tweeting NatCon for extended periods of time is a difficult and stressful thing to do, and there is not much point to maximising this.

I believe that there is room for more cooperation in student media including syndication or sharing of articles between different publications. If *Honi Soit* breaks a major story relating to Monash University, *Lot's Wife* should print it too if it has no capacity to do its own reporting. Even other universities could have an interest in their campus newspaper sharing the article. And if *Farrago* breaks a major national story or publishes a nationally relevant analysis piece, their colleagues at other universities might consider publishing it too.

Famously, eight Australian student newspapers printed the 1995 *Rabelais* article *The Art of Shoplifting*.

Below is an incomplete list of mainly written university student publications which may have campus news from time to time. Today, most student media listed is run by either a student union or faculty staff.
