## The Age Schools Summit 2022

### Background

The Age Schools Summit was hosted by The Age and Informa on 23 March 2022. Below are two of the many items part of the Summit.

#### James Merlino Ministerial Address

James Merlino, Victorian Deputy Premier and Minister for Education, delivered a Ministerial Address. This was followed by a Q&A moderated by Gay Alcorn of The Age. James Merlino is a defender of the current balanced literacy approach to teaching reading which Victoria has generally adhered to in recent history.

#### The Reading Wars - Do we have a winner?

Part of the Education at War section of the Summit. The reading wars is one of several ongoing education wars, which have been renewed by debate over the newly approved in 2022 Australian Curriculum. In addition to the reading wars, Australia continues to experience history/culture wars and mathematics wars.

The reading wars, on how to teach reading to the youngest children, historically was between proponents of whole language practices on one side and phonics practices on the other. In Victoria's recent history, it has adhered to a balanced literacy approach that claims to expose students to both strategies, and the reading wars have in this state and across Australia been over the extent and specific approach of phonics needed.

This panel was moderated by Adam Carey, The Age Education Editor. The panellists were:

- Greg Clement, Clayton South Primary School Principal
- Loretta Piazza, Meadowglen Primary School Principal
- Nathaniel Swain, Brandon Park Primary School Prep teacher and founder of Think Forward Educators
- Diane Snowball, literacy consultant and former teacher
