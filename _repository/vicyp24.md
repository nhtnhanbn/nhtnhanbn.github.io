## Victorian Youth Parliament 2024

### Background

In June of 2023, I visited the State Library to collect primary source material and research relating to the [Victorian Secondary Students Union](/underground). Most of it I have not yet analysed nor published, but it is a rich archive. David Mould is also working sporadically on a compiled history of the student voice movement. Once I was done at the library, I went over to Spring Street to watch some of the Victorian Youth Parliament session. In the galleries, I drafted my [first piece](/msa) about Monash University.

I joined the Whitehorse City Council's Youth Parliament team this year. The [Victorian Youth Parliament](https://vicyouth.ymca.org.au/learning-and-leadership/youth-parliament) has young Victorians 16-25 years old draft a bill in teams of six, then debate and vote on them over a few days at Parliament House. Participants also get the chance to deliver a member's statement, in the style of an adjournment debate. Additionally, there is a national matter of public importance which is debated at all Youth Parliaments around Australia, which this year was on regulation of monopoly. In debates, youth parliamentarians are assigned a specific side to debate on but ultimately have an unbound conscience vote.

At Parliament House I gave a number of speeches, all with a time limit of two minutes. While certain fellow youth parliamentarians were impressively intent about using the programme and their speeches to make/test actual change and influence MPs, I saw it as mainly a performance aimed at the audience sitting in the green house with me. Whilst the programme is for participants aged 16-25 years, this year especially had a younger, overwhelmingly school student cohort. These were the people I had in mind when I spoke, and what I spoke was naturally not necessarily what I believe.

I have decided to post a few of my speeches. The ones that I wrote out are a small minority (and even then sometimes incomplete with space for improvisation), so speeches for which I hold few or no notes (like my second member's statement) cannot be published. Some others would have been recorded or transcribed, but these have not yet been made available.

### School costs

This was a member's statement.

> My statement is addressed to the Minister for Education, and I call on the Minister to take action to ensure that going to a government primary or secondary school is really free.

> Officially, there are supposed to be no compulsory fees to attend a government school. But substantial ancillary costs prevent families and students from being able to enjoy the full benefits of a public education. Free education must mean free participation, access, and quality of education.

> Students should be entitled to free fares on public transport. If it costs money to get to school in the first place, school is not really free.

> Students should receive free uniforms. If it costs money to comply with school rules, school is not really free.

> Students should be able to participate in all activities for free, including excursions and camps. If it costs money to fully participate in school, school is not really free.

> Students should receive free equipment and materials for their subjects. If it costs money to study a subject, school is not really free.

> Students should be taught by qualified and specialised teachers. If it costs money to guarantee appropriately qualified teachers at school, school is not really free.

> Students should have access to a local school fully, without accounting tricks, funded to at the very least the Schooling Resource Standard. If it costs money to receive the minimum standard quality of education, school is not really free.

> Speaker, the reality is that going to school in Victoria costs money. Persistent government failure on this means that schools have had to offload costs to families, teachers and charities. And we need to be clear that especially when cost of living is biting, means-tested measures will exclude many that desperately need the support. If the Education State is honestly committed to universal free education, it needs to be practically, genuinely free for every child, whether their family is poor or whether they are rich.

### Monopoly

The national matter of public importance was a motion that "calls for the Commonwealth Government to introduce breakup powers for concentrated markets".

I wrote my speech before finding out which side I would be formally debating on, which ended up being the side for the motion. I believe that I voted for the motion.

An earlier version of this speech included a denunciation of a trade union, which I replaced on the day. The idea which replaced it is something that I was trying to convey in the rest of the speech, but a conversation that I had the day before with one of this year's great youth parliamentarians crystallised the expression of it.

> What does it mean to be a monopoly? It is when the few dominate the many. In another word, we could call it tyranny. So we should be uncompromising when we say, “smash all monopolies”, and we should understand this broadly.

> We should realise that duopolies and anti-competitive markets are the very same thing as monopoly. Because when they collude to push out competitors, weaponise exploitation and drive up prices, the effect is exactly the same. Remember, when Standard Oil got broken up, the companies that came out of it became part of the “Seven Sisters” cartel which together dominated and controlled global oil production and distribution, whilst propping up American and British imperialism.

> We need to understand that the underlying economic system is itself a monopoly, in which big business dominates the worker and the consumer. Hence, corporate monopolies are an inevitable product of our system, and simple breakup powers alone are only an insufficient band aid. Because it is contrary to the motivations and incentives of the system, the system will overcome it through anticompetitive collusion, like we saw with Standard Oil. So, to smash monopolies means to smash the monopoly of business and capital over the economy.

> We need to recognise our political system as a monopoly, in which the established governing class – bureaucracy, the parties, parliaments – together they dominate the rest of us. So, to smash monopolies means to take power into our own hands, the young people and the marginalised people.

> We must be conscious of wherever monopoly might arise. When all aspects of our society - schools, media and so on - are geared on the assumptions of the monopoly of the status quo, we need imagination to smash monopolies everywhere.

> I will leave you with the words of one of the great opponents of all forms of monopoly, Barry Goldwater, who reminds us that “extremism in the defence of liberty is no vice. And […] moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.”

### Ambition

This was a speech against a bill proposing comprehensive Auslan education. It was a bill proposed by the Hume City Council team, a team which supplied some of the most powerful debaters that I heard in either the green or red house. I voted for the bill.

> This bill is novel and it is bold. I think it is worth recognising and thanking the ambitious and valuable contribution that our friends opposite have given to this discussion.

> With that ambition comes risk and the unknown, and we have already heard some concerns with the practical aspects of this bill. My fear is that passing this bill would distract and divert effort, attention and resources from measures and programmes which have a higher likelihood of success and positive impact, including programmes which are already supported and being implemented by the deaf community and existing organisations.

> As we have heard, this bill has to be implemented on a massive scale and is not targeted to provide the most impact and relevance to deaf and hard of hearing people in an efficient manner. It relies on the creation of a new government bureacracy to enforce and oversee the implementation and compliance requirements as outlined in the bill. For these reasons, I believe that we can provide more practical and directed support by prioritising what has been specifically proposed by the deaf community, acknowledging the diverse range of views and experiences of people in the community.

> These are things like ensuring that functional hearing loops become the norm. Like guaranteeing captions in all media. Like guaranteeing Auslan interpreters at all press conferences and public addresses, and requiring that broadcasters ensure that the Auslan interpreters are visible at all times. Like providing sustainable recurrent funding to community support and advocacy organisations.

### Teacher workload

This was a speech for the bill that my Whitehorse City Council team composed, to increase education on intergenerational trauma, cultural competency and intersectionality in schools. I voted for the bill, which passed unanimously. The bill was admirably refuted by the Hume City Council team, who primarily raised important considerations on the workload and responsibilities of teachers. I believe that even if the goals of the bill and its content are generally correct, critique is important so that it is as rock-solid as possible.

> I want to acknowledge the fantastic work that our teachers and education support staff are doing today. They are doing a lot of that work, and they are doing a lot of work, without proper support from the system.

> One of the important aims of this bill is to help teachers. By giving them the opportunity to gain tools and skills to support students while keeping themselves safe. To be clear, teachers should never be expected to replace other specialised professionals, but with students spending most of their time in the classroom, teachers need and want to be ready.

> Any teacher will want their students to be comfortable, supported and thriving in their classroom. So when they interact with a student who experiences intergenerational trauma, who comes from an intersectional background, or who is culturally diverse, the teacher may or may not be equipped with the understanding, knowledge and skillset to fully support the student – that is not the teacher’s fault.

> What implementing this bill does is provide the initial training, the ongoing professional development, and the community support to give teachers that understanding, that knowledge, that skillset. So that teachers can be confident to work with their students, and equally as importantly to maintain their own mental health. Because we need to be mindful that teachers too come with their own experiences.

> These factors are also why teachers are explicitly a top stakeholder in this bill, with every local committee required to include teacher members. This reflects the importance of teachers in the education system, in the community and in particular what the bill addresses, and that implementing these measures requires keeping teachers a core part of the conversation.

> In creating a society and culture in which we can discuss these issues without stigma, and work together to begin breaking down these cycles of trauma and building healthier communities, teachers will be able to play a central role in their mentorship of the next generation. That is why supporting teachers has been a top priority of this bill.

### Social housing

A taster of the infamous [collapse](/musu) of the Melbourne University Student Union. This was a speech in favour of a bill proposing government-owned student housing. I do not remember my vote.

> Speaker, I am not known for telling stories on the floor of this House, but I do have one today. It is a true story that you may be familiar with.

> Back in the early 2000s, the University of Melbourne had a student organisation called the Melbourne University Student Union, or MUSU in short.

> With an annual budget of more than 10 million dollars, MUSU was a powerful body providing both services and political representation for the students of the University. Keep in mind that MUSU was governed by students.

> MUSU's final years were embroiled in controversy around a deal, worth well over 40 million dollars, to develop student accomodation. With the deal threatening to send it bankrupt, alongside accusations of financial mismanagement and corruption, MUSU was liquidated by the Supreme Court of Victoria and the property was never developed.

> Speaker, inaction, allowing this situation to continue, would be negligence by this House. Our failure means gaps will persist, to be filled by other indpendent organisations without oversight. Like MUSU, there are no guarantees that such programmes will not be affected by incompetence, corruption and rorts. There is no guarantee that such programmes will not end. This bill provides certainty. This bill provides confidence. This bill provides accountability. This bill provides affordability.

### Local government

This was part of a speech against a bill proposing widespread implementation of digester tanks to turn organic waste into biofuels and fertiliser. The debate was chaired by Tim Read, who seemed to have fun.

In an earlier debate, I had extolled the benefits of imposing statewide uniformity on a traditional council issue.

> Despite its facade of nobility, this bill reveals our friends' shocking disregard for local council autonomy. Is nothing sacred?

> Tyranny is what our friends opposite are proposing. We are appalled. I condemn this bill.
