## 2020 issues of the Melbourne High School Sentinel

### Background

The *Sentinel* is the student publication of the Melbourne High School. In its 2020 incarnation, as with recent history, the *Sentinel* was an irregular satirical magazine.

Our Melbourne High School correspondents indicate that no issues of the *Sentinel* were published in 2021.
