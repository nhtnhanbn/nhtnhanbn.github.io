## Radio Monash Special General Meeting July 2023

### Thread

*From my live [Thread @nhan.an.victorian](https://threads.net/t/CuZChX6JUWs).*

The Labor Left are trying to get up to the Radio Monash committee. Despite all positions having been declared vacant, the Labor Right controlled MSA has blocked elections for almost all committee positions, with only President and Vice President to be elected tonight. For both positions, prominent Labor Left figures are running against established Radio Monash members.

More to come.

Meeting in disarray with disputes over the legality of the notice, governance obligations, failure to pass a constitutional amendment. Serious potential that no elections will go ahead.

Earlier, a special resolution failed (with a majority but not the required supermajority in favour) that would have amended the constitution to allow voting rights to members for 21 days rather than 10 business days. The official notice (and I understand also the members list being referred to for votes in the meeting) used 21 days.

A second special resolution passed unanimously, but only after the removal of a controversial clause inserted by a lawyer that would have bound the President to act in the interests of the MSA rather than Radio Monash while acting as a Monash Student Council member.

Establishment candidate for President spruiks their Radio Monash experience in a typical sort of speech for an apolitical position.

First Labor Left candidate for President attacks Radio Monash establishment for failing to modernise and not worth saving, and becoming a "clique" and "in-group". Also calls for more journalism and academic affairs advocacy.

Second Labor Left candidate for President offers an optimistic vision for expansion. Much less hostile.

Has the meeting been stacked? Quorum was reached comfortably, which could reflect member activity/enthusiasm, Labor Left stacking, or both.

I believe that over 20 votes (including a large number of proxies) are controlled by the Labor Left. This number is almost the quorum threshold (25). There are 73 votes in total.

The Labor Left candidates are unfamiliar to most Radio Monash members. They are being interrogated by regular members.

First Labor Left candidate for President claims to have been asked by regular Radio Monash members to run.

They criticise the "2010 CSS" on the website [radiomonash.online](https://radiomonash.online). What is wrong with that?

Voting is underway for President. Remember, the result could be invalidated if the MSA or lawyers feels like the meeting is illegal.

Establishment candidate wins the Presidency, defeating the two Labor Left candidates in a first past the post vote.

The two Labor Left candidates for the Vice Presidency (the same two as nominated for President) withdraw, leaving the establishment candidate to win unopposed.

Meeting closes over 2.5 hours after opening, the Labor Left stack defeated (for now). Elections for most committee positions still to come at a later date.

Why were the Labor Left interested in Radio Monash? Possible reasons:
1) Despite their institutional ignorance, they genuinely believed in modernising Radio Monash, pivoting to journalism, expanding its reach and campaigning on education affairs.
2) The President has a vote on the Monash Student Council, which Labor Right-led ticket Together control practically unopposed.
3) To co-opt Radio Monash as a vehicle to support a ticket in the 2023 MSA elections.
