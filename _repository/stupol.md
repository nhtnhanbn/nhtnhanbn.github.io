## Stupol Stories

### Why?

Why do these stories get recorded in the first place? First, because they raise and explore questions about what student unionism and the university should look like. Second, because some of the names appear again in powerful positions in the adult world (for example, recent Prime Ministers who were notable student politicians include Julia Gillard, Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and Anthony Albanese).

The stories listed here focus on controversial conduct and mismanagement from this century. Not much on clubs because stories are not so often written about them, but I suspect that sections of the clubs space can become highly contested (not just by "stupol" types) with the stories passed down orally. As always, if you know of any stories that would be worth adding, I am listening.
