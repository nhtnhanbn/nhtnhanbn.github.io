## About me

I graduated year 12 in 2022, having completed the VCE with an ATAR of 99.80, and am looking forward to supporting your or your child's learning journey. I am looking to assist students up to and including VCE (Methods and Specialist) in mathematics, a subject I am intending to continue to extend my own knowledge of through university study in engineering .

## VCE Mathematics

Some particular issues for those looking for support in VCE Mathematical Methods or Specialist Mathematics.

### New study designs

In 2023, all mathematics subjects will have a new study design, including new content. I have read through the new study designs and thoroughly consolidated my understanding of all areas of new content which were not present in the previous study design and am confident that I will be able to provide insight into novel (for the VCE) concepts. In particular, my background in olympiad informatics provides existing experience with the newly introduced algorithmic aspects of the new study designs (as well as boolean algebra and logic in the new Specialist Mathematics study design).

### CAS calculators

CAS calculators are an essential part of modern VCE mathematics subjects, with technology-active tasks representing the majority of assessment. I used the Casio ClassPad II, so I can especially assist Casio students with gaining proficiency and navigating the unique challenges of this CAS calculator, including providing custom functions and programs to maximise efficiency in assessments. Nevertheless, users of any calculator still need the fundamental mathematical understanding and application which are prerequisites to effective calculator use. This will always be the core of my teaching, so users of other calculators should not hesitate to have a chat with me.
