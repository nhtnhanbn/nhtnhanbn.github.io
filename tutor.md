## Personalised and targeted maths tutoring

I graduated year 12 in 2022, and am looking forward to supporting your learning journey. I am tutoring because I want to help you to share my passion for maths and succeed in your own personal goals. With 200 hours of teaching and tutoring experience over the past year, I have refined my teaching to most effectively help you.

I am looking to assist students in mathematics up to and including VCE Mathematical Methods as I continue to extend my own knowledge of maths through university study in engineering. I also completed VCE Specialist Mathematics, English, Global Politics, Physics and Chemistry, scoring above a raw 40 study score in every subject, and I am now completing a double degree in Engineering and IT at Monash University, so I am more than happy to chat about any of these other topics.

Lessons are one-on-one, or with a small group of friends if you prefer. My lessons will be personalised and flexible to adapt to your unique needs and requests. I am happy to assist with problems, revise areas of weakness, teach new content or anything else depending on what will be most beneficial to you on a lesson-by-lesson basis. This adaptive and targeted model is intended to complement and enhance what you learn at school, rather than just repeating what you have already been taught.

"I was failing methods last year, and probably would have done the same this year without your help." - thanks to their hard work, this student achieved rank 1 in SACs in their Methods cohort.

- ATAR 99.80
